## What I Do

As an aspiring full stack developer, I enjoy tackling various aspects of software development. Here are some highlights of what I'm involved in:

### Personal Projects

Although I don't have any completed projects to showcase at the moment, I have some exciting ideas in the pipeline:

- **PokeMarket:** A unique buy system that revolves around the fascinating world of PokÃ©mon!
- **FlickList:** With FlickList, you can curate your own watchlists and create custom collections that reflect your unique cinematic preferences. Discover, organize, and explore a vast library of films tailored to your taste.
- **RhythmMix:** With RhythmMix, you can dive into a world of curated playlists that cater to your unique musical taste and preferences. Whether you're seeking a playlist based on a specific genre, a favorite song, or an adored artist, RhythmMix has got you covered.

I'm currently in the planning and development stages for these projects. Stay tuned for updates as I bring these ideas to life! Feel free to share any suggestions or thoughts you might have.
